- [monografia](./tcc-monografia): The final part of the project, it contains the full thesis written throughout the year. The thesis PDF can be found [here](./tcc-monografia/pg-sophie-dilhon.pdf).

# Project

The project developed is called SCAP, and it aims to help manage requests from professors of the Department of Informatics (DI) at the Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo (UFES) for leave to attend conferences.
